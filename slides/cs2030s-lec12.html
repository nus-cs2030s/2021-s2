Real-world software is complex, evolves continuously, and is a product of team work. 

---
class: middle

CS2030S teaches you how to write better code, where "better" means:

- more human-friendly
- easier to change and maintain
- fewer crashes

through programming paradigms, idioms, and language design.

---
class: middle

### Reducing Boiler Plates

- Code becomes more succinct and easier to read
- Change should happen only in one place

---
class: middle

### The Abstraction Principle

"Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts." 

-- _Benjamin C. Pierce_

# Writing code that is Extensible

---
class: middle wide

## Composition 

Models the HAS-A relationship

---
class: middle wide

## Polymorphism 
_many forms_

The ability of objects to take on many forms.

---
class: middle wide

## Polymorphism 

.tiny[
```Java
void say(Object obj) {
    System.out.println("Hi, I am " + obj.toString());
}

Point p = new Point(0, 0);
say(p);
Circle c = new Circle(p, 4);
say(c);
```

---
class: middle wide

## Abstract Classes

So general that it should not be instantiated.

```Java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract public double getArea();
}
```
---
class: middle wide

## In Python
.tiny[
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape:
    @abstractmethod
    def getArea(self):
        pass
 
class Circle(Shape):
    def noofsides(self):
        return ...
```
]
---
class: middle wide

## Interfaces
```Java
interface GetAreable {
	double getArea();
}
```
---

class: middle wide

### A class can only inherit from one class (or abstract class).

### A class can implement multiple interfaces.


---

class: middle wide

## Minimizing the effect of changing implementation 

When the client does not know the implementation details of a class/method, they are not dependent on the specific way it has been implemented.

You can make a change to how something is computed and the client is none the wiser.

---
class: middle

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

If $S$ is a subclass of $T$, then an object of type $T$ can be replaced by that of type $S$ without changing the _desirable property_ of the program

---

class: middle

## Substitutability _does not_ simply mean "has a subtype relationship". 

Just because a class inherits from another class does not mean it is substitutable.
---

class: middle
Recall our `Square` / `Rectangle` example from the recitation.

Consider:
```Java
Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(3,3);
Rectangle r2 = new Square(3);
r1.setHeight(2);
r2.setHeight(2);
```
---
class: middle,wide

In `Rectangle`:

```Java
public void setHeight(double height) {
	this.height = height;
}
```
The desirable property of the method here is to change the length of rectangle. Nothing more, nothing less.

---
class: middle,wide

In `Square`:
```Java
public void setHeight(double height) {
	this.height = height;
	this.length = height;
}
```
We change both sides of the square. This has changed the desirable property of the method. Can't be substituted, but `Square` $<:$ `Rectangle`.

---
class: middle wide

LSP is the L in SOLID. Although we do not cover this in the module, it is good to know about. 

---
class: middle wide

## Generics

Allows us to write re-usable code and still maintain type safety

---
class: middle wide

Recall our `Pair` class:

.tiny[
```Java
class Pair {
	private Object first;
	private Object second;
  
	public Pair(Object first, Object second) {
		this.first = first;
		this.second = second;
	}
  
	Object getFirst() {
		return this.first;
	}
  
	Object getSecond() {
		return this.second;
	}
  }
```
]
---

class: middle wide

and our `Pair<T>` class:

.tiny[
```Java
class Pair<S,T> {
	private S first;
	private T second;
  
	public Pair(S first, T second) {
		this.first = first;
		this.second = second;
	}

	S getFirst() {
		return this.first;
	}
  
	T getSecond() {
		return this.second;
	}
}
```

Things to remember about generics:
- invariance
- contravariance
- covariance
- PECS (producer extends, consumer super)
- the effects of type erasure
- Arrays and Generics are not BFFs

---

class: middle wide

# The compiler is your friend!

---
background-image: url(figures/memes/drake-runtime-vs-compile-time.jpg)

---
class: middle wide
Catching errors early (during compile time not during run time)

Why is this preferrable? You can catch these problems before they mainfest themselves in the real world. i.e. Autopilot

There are of course still errors that occur at run time.
---
class: middle wide

## Type Safety

The compiler uses checks that all of your types line up correctly and type inference to check that your code is type safe before letting you run it.

---
class: middle wide

# Handling increasingly complex code

---
class: middle wide

## Isolating the moving parts

- Encapsulation
- Information Hiding
- Tell Don't Ask

---
## Encapsulation
.tiny[
```Java
class Circle {
	double x;
	double y;
	double r;
  
	double getArea() {
	  return 3.141592653589793 * r * r;
	}
  }
```
]
---
class: middle wide

## Information Hiding
.tiny[
```Java
class Circle {
	private double x;
	private double y;
	private double r;
  
	public double getArea() {
	  return 3.141592653589793 * r * r;
	}
  }
```
]
---
class: middle wide

## Tell, Don't Ask
.tiny[
```Java
double cX = c.getX();
double cY = c.getY();
double r = c.getR();
boolean isInCircle = ((x - cX) * (x - cX) + (y - cY) * (y - cY)) <= r * r;
```
]

vs

.tiny[
```Java
boolean isInCircle = c.contains(x, y);
```
]
---
class: middle

## Minimizing the moving parts

- Immutability
- Pure functions

---
class: middle wide
.tiny[
```Java
final class Point {
    final private double x;
    final private double y;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public Point moveTo(double x, double y) {
        return new Point(x, y);
    }
}
```
]
---
class: middle wide
.tiny[
```Java
final class Circle {
    final private Point c;
    final private double r;

    public Circle (Point c, double r) {
        this.c = c;
        this.r = r;
    }
     :
    public Circle moveTo(double x, double y) {
        return new Circle(c.moveTo(x, y), r);
    }
}
```
]
---
class: middle wide
.tiny[
```Java
Point p = new Point(0, 0);
Circle c1 = new Circle(p, 1);
Circle c2 = new Circle(p, 4);
c1.moveTo(1, 1); // c1 remains unchanged
```
]

Don't have the same issue with aliasing!

Immutability makes our programs easier to reason about.

# Misc Paradigms and Topics

# Exceptions

---
class: middle,center

## `try`-`catch`-`finally`

---
class: middle

```Java
try {
  // do something
} catch (an exception parameter) {
  // handle exception
} finally {
  // clean up code
  // even if no exception was thrown
}
```

## Exception Hierarchy

### Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions
### Do NOT Use Exception As a Control Flow Mechanism

---
class: middle

## Asynchronous Programming

Using the `CompletableFuture` class to create pipelines of computation that can be done asychronously.

Known in other languages as Futures (python) or Promises (javascript/source)

---
class: middle

## `Streams`

Concentrate on what needs to be computed, don't worry about handling loops.

The Java implementation of `InfiniteList`. You have also implemented streams in CS1101S.

---
class: middle,center

Using stream in place of loops should make our code simpler, more elegant, and less bug-prone. 

One should note that not all loops can be translated into stream elegantly. 

A double-nested loop, for instance, stretches the elegance of streams. 

A triple-nested loop should perhaps be best written as a loop with appropriate inner components written with lambdas and streams.

# OOP vs FP

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(figures/memes/two-buttons-oop-vs-fp.jpg)

---
class: middle, center

We are not telling you "OOP is better" or "FP is better"

---
class: middle, center

"Here are different ways you can write your code.  Pick one that is best for you."

---
class: middle

- Core strength of OOP is polymorphism (easy to extend)
- Core strength of FP is referential transparency (easy to reason)

---
class: middle

"OO programming is good, when you know what it is.  Functional programming is good, when you know what it is.  And functional OO programming is also good, once you know what it is" - Uncle Bob.

# Java vs. Other Languages

---
class: middle, center

### Java is a nice OOP language, but a clunky FP language

But, sometimes, you have no choice.

---
class: middle

### If you have to use Java, consider other libraries with immutability collections and other monadic constructs

- JOOL, Vavr, Fugue
- Google Guava
- Apache Commons
- etc

---
class: middle

### If you have other languages to choose from:

- *Parallel/Concurrent*: Erlang, Go, etc
- *Functional*: Haskell, Erlang, OCaml, F#, etc
- *OO Functional*: JS, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, Switft, etc,
