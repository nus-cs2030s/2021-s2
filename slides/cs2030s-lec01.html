Real-world software is complex, evolves continuously, and is a product of team work. 

---
class: middle

CS2030S teaches you how to write better code, where "better" means:

- more human-friendly
- easier to change and maintain
- fewer crashes

through programming paradigms, idioms, and language design.

---
class: middle

CS2030S is not a module about 

- algorithms or efficiency
- software design 
- Java language and libraries

Compiler is our friend

- it helps us catch errors early
- but can only based on the code
- not by running it

---
class: middle,center

### A well-designed programming language should help us catch errors during compilation phase as soon as possible.

---
class: middle,center

### Variable: Abstraction over Data

---
class: middle

### The _type_ of a variable decides the computation that can be performed on a variable.

---
class: middle

### _Type system_: A set of rules about types of variables, expression, functions, and their interactions.

---
class: middle

### Static vs. Dynamic Types 

---
class: middle

### Dynamically Typed

```Python
x = 4
x = "5" # Ok
```

---
class: middle

### Statically Typed

```Java
int x;
x = 4;
x = "5" // error
```

---
class: middle

### When dynamically type language is annoying

```Python
i = 0
while i < 100:
   i = something_slow()
print("i is " + i)
```

---
class: middle

---
class: middle,center

### Java is a statically typed language.

---
class: middle

### The type assigned to variable during declaration is called the _compile-time type_.

---
class: middle

## Strong vs. Weak Typing 

---
class: middle

### in C (weak typing)

```C
int x;
x = 4;
x = (int)"5"; // okay, fine..
```

---
class: middle

### in Java (strong typing)

```C
int x;
x = 4;
x = (int)"5"; // error
```

---
class: middle

### in Java (strong typing)

```C
int x;
x = 4;
x = (int)"5"; // error
```

---
class: middle

### Primitive Types in Java

- `byte`, `short`,  `int`, `long` 
- `float`, `double`
- `char`
- `boolean`

---
class: middle

### Primitive types in Java do not share their values

```Java
int i = 10;
int j = i;
i = i + 1;
```

---
class: middle

### Subtype and Supertype

A type $T$ is a _subtype_ of $S$ ($T <: S$) if:

- a piece of code written for variables of type $S$ can also safely be used on variables of type $T$. 

$S$ is a _supertype_ of $T$.

---
class: middle

### Subtyping Among Java Primitive Types

- `byte` $<:$ `short` $<:$ `int` $<:$ `long`
- `long` $<:$ `float` $<:$ `double`
- `char` $<:$ `int`

---
class: middle

### Subtyping is Reflective and Transitive

- $T <: T$
- if $S <: T$ and $T <: U$, then $S <: U$.

---
class: middle

### Java Widening Type Conversion 

Java allows putting a value of type $T$ into a variable of type $S$ iff $T <: S$.

---
class: middle,center

### Function: Abstraction over Computation

---
class: middle

.small[
```C
int i = 10;
int fac10 = 1;
while (i >= 0) {
  fac10 *= i;
  i -= 1;
}
i = 5;
int fac5 = 1;
while (i >= 0) {
  fac5 *= i;
  i -= 1;
}
```
]

---
class: middle

.small[
```C
int factorial(int i) {
	int fac = 1;
	while (i >= 0) {
	  fac *= i;
	  i -= 1;
	}
	return fac;
}
int fac10 = factorial(10);
int fac5 = factorial(5);
```
]

### Function as an abstraction barrier

---
class: middle,center

### Abstraction: Composite Data Type

---
class: middle

```C
typedef struct {
	double x;
	double y;
	double r;
} circle;
```

---
class: middle

```C
circle c;
c.x = 1.0;
c.y = 1.0;
c.r = 5.0;
double area = circle_get_area(c);
```

---
class: middle

```C
double circle_get_area(circle c) {
	return 3.1415926 * c.r * c.r;
}
```

---
class: middle, center

### Encapsulation: bundle related variables and functions together to create a _class_

---
class: middle

In Java, the keyword `class` allows us to define a new class named `Circle`.

```Java
class Circle {
    double x;
    double y;
    double r;
}
```

---
class: middle

```Java
class Circle {
    double x;
    double y;
    double r;
    
    double getArea() {
      return 3.1415926 * r * r;
    }
}
```

---
class: middle

In Java classes:

 - Functions are known as _methods_
 
 - The bundled data in the class are known as _fields_ (or members, or states, or attributes)

---
class: middle

Objects are instances of a class.

In Java, the keyword `new` creates (or _instantiates_) an object of a given class.
```Java
Circle c = new Circle();
```

---
class: middle

Unlike before, we can now call the method `getArea` on the `Circle` object rather than passing it to the method.
```Java
Circle c = new Circle();
c.r = 10;
double area = c.getArea();
```

---
class: middle, center

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---
class: middle

A program runs by instantiating objects of different classes.

These objects interact with each other by calling each others' methods.

---
class: middle

### An Example: Modelling a Bank

Classes: `BankAccount`, `Customer`, `Teller`, ...

Fields: `balance`, `creditRating`, `accountNumber`, ...

Methods: `withdraw`, `deposit`, `loan`, ...

---
class: middle
###Java Reference Types

Everything else that is not a primitive type. Our new `Circle` class is an example.

---
class: middle, wide
A reference variable stores only the reference to the value not the value itself.
```Java
Circle c1 = new Circle();
Circle c2 = c1;
System.out.println(c2.r); // print 0
c1.r = 10.0;
System.out.println(c2.r); // print 10.0
```

---
class: middle

What about sub/supertype relationships among Java Reference Types?

We will get there don't worry!

---
class: middle, wide

What happens if we don't initialise our reference variable?

```Java
Circle c1;
c1.r = 10.0;  // NullPointerException
```

All non-initialised variables will have the special reference value `null`.
