## Vim Plugins/Extensions on PE Hosts

We allow the following plugins on the PE nodes during the practical exams.  

Note that for your labs, you are free to install any plugins you find useful.

## Background

`vim` plugins are installed under `~/.vim/pack/plugins/start`.  We will auto-create this directory for you in the exam environment.

`vim` colorschemes are installed under `~/.vim/colors`.  You put `<scheme>.vim` under `~/.vim/colors` directly.

Before running all the `ln -s` commands to add the plugins, you will need to create the folders that store the plugins. To do so, run
```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
```

## Color Schemes

We have installed the [Sweeter-than-Fiction](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-colorschemes-sweeter-than-fiction) colorscheme bundle under `~cs2030s/.vim/colors`.

To use this, run
```
ln -s ~cs2030s/.vim/vim-colorschemes/colors ~/.vim/colors
```

After that, your can change your vim color scheme as usual. 
```
:color gruvbox
```

The bundle includes some of the popularly requested color schemes, such as `monokai`, `solarized`, and `gruvbox`
